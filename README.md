# Asessing the impact of traffic congesion charges in London

This project examined the impact of traffic toxicity charges introduced in London to reduce high traffic flow and air pollution in the central London area. Specifically, we tested whether regions at the border of charge zones were negatively impacted due to people traveling around the edge of zones to avoid charges. Additionally, we attempted to replicate previous findings demonstrating that the intervention led to an improvement in air quality within the charge zone.

This project was completed as part of the DS4A/Women's fellowship. The code included here is only a sample of the project.
